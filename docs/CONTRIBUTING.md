## Features

(Sorry for the strict rules, but it's so that the general environment of the repo forms)

### Adding features
In general, added components do not have to be specifically for scouting, but components that gives elements functions or they can be peusdo-tutorial components (prestyled/template components). 

### Removing features
For removing features of the component library, you should verify that what you are removing meets the following criteria:
 + Has too basic of a function
 + Is not used by any other components
 + Has approval to be removed
